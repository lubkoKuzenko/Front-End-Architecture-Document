`Definition of Done` is a list of criteria that has to be met before any work can be considered done. Failure to meet any one of these conditions means the work is not complete

### Who Defines Definition of Done?

Scrum team defines the definition of done. They are the ones who will be accountable to meet this definition, so itâ€™s essential that the team creates it and agrees to it. In some cases, the definition of done can be at an organization level or at a product level but even in such cases, the scrum team would need to agree to it and make modifications as required to fit their product increment needs.

### When do we create the Definition of Done?

The team would need to use this definition in the first sprint when they would mark the first product increment as done. That means the definition of done should create before the first sprint or latest within the first sprint itself.
